        <h1>Course Details</h1>
        <h2>Program Objective:</h2>
        <p>Paper II of the Prelims, or the CSAT Course, is often taken lightly by students due to its qualifying nature. However, given the recent trends, this paper also requires a reasonable level of preparation and has proven that CSAT is the game-changer in qualifying prelims. Thus, we designed this 100 Days Foundation Program to develop sound conceptual clarity and encourage you to practice consistently! Irrespective of your previous performance in competitive examinations, we lay a strong foundation for your basics and help you understand the concepts logically rather than through formulas. Above all, we provide the courage, confidence, and hope needed to ace the CSAT exam.</p>

                <h3>Dr. Pavani Reddy</h3>
                <p>This is Dr. Pavani Reddy. Being from medical background, I was sceptical about CSAT preparation since initial days of my UPSC Journey. Unfortunately, it proved in my last attempt.Later, I had enrolled for CSAT course under Ram Mohan Pandey sir. After attending all the classes as well as doubts sessions, I gained immense confidence(As we all know, confidence is the key to success). Sir's lucid way of formulae free teaching, efforts to correct the thinking method of students helped  me to overcome the fear of CSAT.  </p>

                <p>Hello sir ! I'm glad that I came to know regarding your aptitude sessions . From 2019 I have been following your CSAT videos and I found it extremely useful . I hate aptitude and numbers from the beginning, and I found your lectures very interesting and useful . You're approachable anytime. You made CSAT easy to understand when I was struggling with it !</p>

                <p>Ram sir's method of teaching is simply amazing!. He has a clear understanding about what UPSC CSAT demands. Under his guidance I was able to clear UPSC CSAT, UPSC CDS & AFCAT written exams.! The best thing about him is that he pays personal attention  on each and every student. Kudos to ungist.
